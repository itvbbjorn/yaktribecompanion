# Armour | NecroRAW
[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
Unless stated otherwise, a fighter may only be equipped with one type of armour at a time. However, certain types of armour can be combined with others. Where this is the case, the rules will state it.

Trading Post Armour[​](#trading-post-armour "Direct link to Trading Post Armour")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ablative Overlay[​](#ablative-overlay "Direct link to Ablative Overlay")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**20 Credits - Common**

_Sometimes, the best way to improve a suit of armour is to add even more armour over the top. An ablative overlay is a layer of armour that can be worn in addition to another suit of armour, or can be worn on its own. It can range from sophisticated gel coatings and reactive plates, to more primitive furs quilted with ballistic cloth and fragments from ruined armour pieces._

The first time a fighter wearing an ablative overlay is required to make a save, their save is 2 better than normal (i.e., a model with a 5+ save would gain a 3+ save). A model without a save gains a 5+ save. The second time they must make a save, it becomes 1 better than normal or 6+ if they did not already have a save.

After the fighter has been hit twice, the ablative overlay is spent and has no further effect on the battle, but is retained by the fighter and may be used again in future battles.

### Archaeo-Carapace[​](#archaeo-carapace "Direct link to Archaeo-Carapace")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**120 Credits – Rare (12)**

_An ancient device from the Dark Age of Technology, the Archaeo-carapace is a piston-driven rig that grafts itself to the user. It offers impressive protection, but at the same time slowly begins to take over the wearer, until there is little distinction between them and the machine._

An Archaeo-carapace grants its wearer a 4+ save.

If the wearer suffers a Lasting Injury result of Humiliated, Head Injury, Eye Injury, Hand Injury, Hobbled, Spinal Injury or Enfeebled, instead of suffering the effects of the injury they gain a bionic (see [Bionics](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/bionics)) appropriate to the location damaged (i.e., if a Head Injury was suffered, they would gain a Cortex-cogitator bionic). These bionics do not increase the fighter's characteristics. Unlike normal bionics, they cannot be damaged or destroyed, and if the fighter suffers an injury to a location already replaced by a bionic then the injury is ignored.

Transformation into a blasphemous cyber-creature is not without its perils, however. Whenever the fighter activates they must roll a D6. If the result is less than the number of bionics they currently have, they gain the Insane condition. If the fighter ever has six or more bionics, they vanish into the underhive never to be seen again – the player must remove the fighter from their gang roster

### Armourweave[​](#armourweave "Direct link to Armourweave")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**20 Credits – Illegal (9)**

_A product of xenos science, the armourweave suit combines psycho-reactive plastics and kinetic bafflers to deaden blows. Armourweave is also practically impossible to tear or cut, meaning even against the most powerful attacks it will offer some measure of protection._

Armourweave grants its wearer a save of 5+. This save cannot be reduced to lower than 6+ by AP or other modifiers, though attacks that do not allow a save will ignore Armourweave as normal.

### Carapace[​](#carapace "Direct link to Carapace")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Carapace armour falls into two broad categories. Light carapace armour offers good protection all over but falls short of covering the wearer from head to toe. Heavy carapace armour is a more complete suit of armour and offers extra protection._

**Light:** _80 credits – Rare (10)_ Light carapace armour grants a 4+ save roll.

**Heavy:** _100 credits – Rare (11)_ Heavy carapace armour grants a 4+ save roll. This is increased to 3+ against attacks originating within the fighter's vision arc (the 90° arc to their front); check this before the fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not clear if the attacker is within the fighter's front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker's base is within the arc, use the 3+ save roll. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the fighter does not have a facing (for example, if they are prone), use the 4+ save roll. However, due to the extra weight of this armour, the fighter's Initiative is reduced by -1 and their movement by 1" when making a Charge action.

### Ceramite Shield[​](#ceramite-shield "Direct link to Ceramite Shield")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**40 Credits – Rare (8)**

_Ceramite shields are made from scavenged armoured plating destined for the military vehicles of the Imperium. As much mobile cover as personal protection, they are lugged into battle by burly gangers who don't mind the weight compared to the benefits the shield affords._

A fighter with a Ceramite shield adds +2 to their save against attacks originating in their line of sight provided they are Standing, however for the wielder the Move action becomes a (Basic) action rather than a (Simple) action.

A fighter with a Ceramite shield ignores the effects of the Melta trait if an attack originates in their line of sight. A fighter can be equipped with a Ceramite shield in addition to a suit of armour, however a fighter carrying a Ceramite shield reduces the number of weapons they can carry by one.

### Flak[​](#flak "Direct link to Flak")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

_Flak armour is perhaps the most common type seen in the underhive. Made with layers of thick, protective material bonded together, it offers protection against cuts and abrasions without hampering mobility. Certain improved types, however, are only readily available to Lord Helmawr's Enforcers, though versions (sometimes with the blood of fallen Enforcers still on them) do appear on the Black Market._

**Flak Armour:** _10 credits - Common_ Flak armour grants a 6+ save roll. Against weapons that use a Blast marker or Flame template, this is increased to a 5+ save roll.

### Gutterforged Cloak[​](#gutterforged-cloak "Direct link to Gutterforged Cloak")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**15 Credits - Common**

_Made from fragments of ruined armour, a Gutterforged cloak provides protection at a very modest price. Common among badzones settlers, the cloak is also designed to offer some measure of defence against the hazards of the underhive or ash wastes._

A Gutterforged cloak grants its wearer a save of 6+, or a save of 5+ against damage resulting from Underhive Perils or environmental effects.

### Hazard Suit[​](#hazard-suit "Direct link to Hazard Suit")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**10 Credits – Rare (10)**

_The ash wastes are a hostile place, their dunes frequently toxic or corrosive, and strong winds whip up regular ash storms capable of blasting any exposed skin raw in minutes. Consequently, those such as ash crust miners and the poor wretches who maintain a hive’s outer armoured skin frequently wear heavy suits of rubberised canvas with vulcanised plates that protect them from the dangers of their working environment._

A hazard suit grants a 6+ save roll. Additionally, when a hazard suit is combined with a respirator, the fighter’s Toughness is increased by 3 against Gas attacks, rather than the usual 2. Finally, a fighter wearing a hazard suit is immune to the Blaze and Rad-phage traits.

### Mantle Malifica[​](#mantle-malifica "Direct link to Mantle Malifica")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**75 Credits – Illegal (13)**

_Constructed from pieces of gore-forged metal, a Mantle Malifica incorporates profane icons and Warp-infused materials to protect its wearer from harm. Unfortunately, wearing such a tainted garment will slowly erode the mind and soul of all but the most strong-willed – or those already insane._

A Mantle Malifica grants its wearer a 5+ save, or an unmodifiable 4+ save against the effects of psychic powers.

Note that this save, if successful, does not cancel the use of a psychic power, it only renders the wearer immune to the power's effects. In the End phase of each round, the wearer must make a Willpower test or gain the [Insane condition](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/general-principles/conditions#insane).

### Mesh Armour[​](#mesh-armour "Direct link to Mesh Armour")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**15 Credits - Common**

_Constructed from tiny metal rings linked together, mesh armour offers more protection than flak without sacrificing any of the wearer's mobility. Worn in large quantities however, it can become extremely heavy._

Mesh armour grants a 5+ save roll.

### Reflec Shroud[​](#reflec-shroud "Direct link to Reflec Shroud")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**30 Credits – Rare (8)**

_Created from layers of reflective metals, a reflec shroud provides an effective ward against energy weapons._

A reflec shroud grants its wearer a save of 5+.

The wearer also counts the AP of las, plasma and melta weapons as '-' regardless of their actual AP.

### Scrap Shield[​](#scrap-shield "Direct link to Scrap Shield")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**15 Credits - Common**

_Sometimes, fighters fashion crude shields from bits of barricades or simply panels prised from tunnel walls. These are then painted in gang colours and affixed to other suits of armour, either strapped to an arm or mounted over a shoulder._

A fighter can be equipped with a scrap shield in addition to a suit of armour. The scrap shield offers no protection against ranged attacks, but while Standing and Engaged, the fighter increases their save by 1 against Reaction attacks.

* * *

Exclusive Armour[​](#exclusive-armour "Direct link to Exclusive Armour")
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Armoured Bodyglove[​](#armoured-bodyglove "Direct link to Armoured Bodyglove")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: House of Artifice_  
**Van Saar only**

The fighters of House Van Saar are somewhat protected from the effects of their own rad weapons by their armour and are therefore immune to the effects of the Rad-phage Weapon Trait (i.e., they will not suffer the additional Flesh Wound) unless otherwise noted.

In addition, if a fighter is wearing an armoured bodyglove, their save roll is improved by 1. For example, if they are wearing flak armour and an armoured bodyglove, they would have a 5+ save, which would be increased to 4+ against Blasts. If a fighter does not already have a save roll, an armoured bodyglove grants a 6+ save.

Unlike other types of armour, an armoured bodyglove may be combined with other types of armour. It may not, however, be combined with an armoured undersuit.

### Furnace Plates[​](#furnace-plates "Direct link to Furnace Plates")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: House of Chains_  
**Goliath and Slave Ogryns only**

Furnace plates grant a 6+ save roll. This is increased to a 5+ save roll against attacks originating within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc to their front); check this before the fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not clear if the attacker is within the fighter’s Front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker’s base is within the arc, use the 5+ save roll. Against attacks with the Blast trait, use the centre of the Blast marker in place of the attacker. If the fighter does not have a facing (for example, if they are Prone), use the 6+ save roll.

### Hardened Flak Armour[​](#hardened-flak-armour "Direct link to Hardened Flak Armour")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: The Book of Judgement_  
**Enforcers only**  
**[The Book of Ruin: Trading Post Appendix](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-ruin-trading-post-appendix) only, 20 Credits – Rare (10)**

Flak armour grants a 6+ save roll. Against weapons that use a Blast marker or Flame template, this is increased to a 5+ save roll. Additionally, when an enemy fighter makes a ranged attack against a fighter wearing hardened flak armour, the Armour Penetration of the weapon used is decreased by 1, to a minimum of 1.

### Layered Flak Armour[​](#layered-flak-armour "Direct link to Layered Flak Armour")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: The Book of Judgement_  
**Enforcers only**  
**[The Book of Ruin: Trading Post Appendix](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-ruin-trading-post-appendix) only, 20 Credits – Rare (8)**

Layered flak armour grants a 5+ save roll. Against weapons that use a Blast marker or Flame template, this is increased to a 4+ save roll.

### Hardened Layered Flak Armour[​](#hardened-layered-flak-armour "Direct link to Hardened Layered Flak Armour")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: The Book of Judgement_  
**Enforcers only**  
**[The Book of Ruin: Trading Post Appendix](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-ruin-trading-post-appendix) only, 35 Credits – Rare (11)**

Hardened layered flak armour grants a 5+ save roll. Against weapons that use a Blast marker or Flame template, this is increased to a 4+ save roll. Additionally, when an enemy fighter makes a ranged attack against a fighter wearing hardened layered flak armour, the Armour Penetration of the weapon used is decreased by 1, to a minimum of 1.

### Incombustible Hauberk[​](#incombustible-hauberk "Direct link to Incombustible Hauberk")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: House of Faith_  
**Redemptionists only**

Woven from flame retardant materials, the robes worn by many Redemptionists offer a degree of protection against the flames of their holy wrath, fuelling the belief of many that these fanatics are indeed protected from cleansing fire by the Emperor's blessing. When a fighter wearing an incombustible hauberk is hit by a weapon with the Blaze trait, roll a D6. On a 5+, they do not become subject to the Blaze condition. Additionally, a fighter wearing an incombustible hauberk that has become subject to the Blaze condition may add 1 to the dice roll when attempting to put the fire out. An incombustible hauberk can be used with other types of armour.

### Plate Mail[​](#plate-mail "Direct link to Plate Mail")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: The Book of Ruin_  
**Corpse Grinder Cult only** Plate mail grants a 6+ save roll. This is increased to a 5+ save roll against attacks originating within the fighter’s vision arc (the 90° arc to their front); check this before the fighter model is placed Prone and is Pinned. If it is not clear if the attacker is within the fighter’s front arc, use a Vision Arc template to check – if the centre of the attacker’s base is within the arc, use the 5+ save roll. Against attacks with the Blast trait, plate mail always grants a 5+ save roll.

# Field Armour | NecroRAW
Any fighter may wear one or more types of field armour. These provide an alternative to conventional armour and may be worn as well as conventional armour. The save they offer cannot be modified by a weapon's Armour Piercing value. However, a fighter can only make one save attempt per attack, therefore the controlling player must choose to either make a save attempt using the fighter's armour save, or using a field.

### Conversion Field[​](#conversion-field "Direct link to Conversion Field")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**60 Credits – Rare (11)**

_A conversion field works by transforming the kinetic energy of an attack into light energy, absorbing the impact in a blinding flash._

When a fighter wearing a conversion field is hit by an attack, roll a D6. On a 5+, the conversion field works and the attack has no further effect. However, any fighters, friend or foe, within 3" of the wearer count as being hit by a weapon with the Flash trait as the field flares up in a tremendous burst of light. Note that the wearer is unaffected by this flash of light as they are inside the field.

### Displacer Field[​](#displacer-field "Direct link to Displacer Field")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**70 Credits – Rare (12)**

_A displacer field reacts to the energy of an impact by teleporting the wearer a safe distance away. The harder the impact, the further the wearer will be moved._

For each hit a fighter wearing a displacer field suffers, roll a D6. On a 4+, the fighter is protected from harm by the field and the hit is ignored (even if any part of the fighter is still under the template – if the attack used one – after being displaced as described below).

*   If a fighter is saved from one or more hits by a displacer field, they will be moved once as the field displaces them. The fighter is moved a number of inches equal to the Strength of the attack in a random direction, determined by rolling a Scatter dice.
*   A displacer field will not deposit its wearer inside a terrain feature – the fighter will move by the shortest route possible so that it can be placed clear of any impassable terrain features.
*   Similarly, the fighter's base cannot overlap another fighter's base and the wearer must be moved by the shortest route possible until its base can be placed without overlapping.
*   Note that the wearer may not end up within 1" of an enemy fighter as a result of being displaced and must be moved by the shortest possible route so that they can be placed 1" away.

However, displacer fields are notoriously oblivious to safe footings. A fighter wearing a displacer field may simply be flung into the open air. If, after being displaced, any part of the fighter's base is overhanging a hazard or overhanging a platform edge, the fighter must pass an Initiative test or will fall, following all of the rules for falling as required by the terrain type being fought over. If the entirety of the fighter's base is over a hazard or in the open air, they will simply fall.

If a fighter wearing a displacer field is transported off the battlefield, they immediately go Out of Action. Do not roll on the Lasting Injury chart, they are automatically Out Cold.

If an attack does not have a Strength value, then a displacer field cannot work against it.

### Refractor Field[​](#refractor-field "Direct link to Refractor Field")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**50 Credits – Rare (10)**

_A refractor field bends the energy of an attack around the wearer, harmlessly distributing it over a large area and robbing the attack of its lethal force._

When a fighter wearing a refractor field is hit by an attack, roll a D6. On a 5+, the hit is ignored.

However, should the field work and the hit be ignored, roll another D6. If the result is a 1, then the field has been overburdened by the attack and its generator is burned out. Remove the refractor field from the fighter's card – it no longer works.

# Bionics | NecroRAW

### Lobo Chip[​](#lobo-chip "Direct link to Lobo Chip")

**(Humiliated Lasting Injury Table Result)**

_The underhive is dangerous and more than enough to break the mind of a ganger. Some fighters choose to get a lobo chip hammered into their cranium, diminishing their emotions to a dull murmur._

**Mundane:** _20 credits – Rare (11)_ Increase either the fighter's Leadership or Cool by +1.

**Improved:** _45 credits – Rare (12)_ Increase both the fighter's Leadership and Cool by +1.

### Cortex-Cogitator[​](#cortex-cogitator "Direct link to Cortex-Cogitator")

**(Head Injuries Lasting Injury Table Result)**

_A spinal thought-shunt, the cortex-cogitator enhances or repairs a fighter's reasoning processes and mental fortitude._

**Mundane:** _15 credits – Rare (11)_ Increase either the fighter's Intelligence or Willpower by +1.

**Improved:** _30 credits – Rare (12)_ Increase both the fighter's Intelligence and Willpower by +1.

### Bionic Eye[​](#bionic-eye "Direct link to Bionic Eye")

**(Eye Injuries Lasting Injury Table Result)**

_From bespoke models crafted to match a user's own natural organs, to crude hatchet jobs prised from the ocular sockets of smashed servo-skulls, bionic eyes restore sight._

**Mundane:** _45 credits – Rare (13)_ The fighter's Ballistic Skill is increased by +1.

### Bionic Arm[​](#bionic-arm "Direct link to Bionic Arm")

**(Hand Injuries Lasting Injury Table Result)**

_A good bionic arm is another weapon in its user's arsenal, able to both replace the function of an arm but also act as a handy club._

**Mundane:** _45 credits – Rare (13)_ The fighter's Weapon Skill is increased by +1.

### Bionic Leg[​](#bionic-leg "Direct link to Bionic Leg")

**(Hobbled Lasting Injury Table Result)**

_At its most basic, a bionic leg replaces the function of a flesh and blood limb, whether cobbled together from old servitor bits or crafted from advanced materials._

**Mundane:** _25 credits – Rare (12)_ The fighter's Movement is increased by +1".

### Skeletal Enhancers[​](#skeletal-enhancers "Direct link to Skeletal Enhancers")

**(Spinal Injury Lasting Injury Table Result)**

_Skeletal enhancers repair damage and function to a fighter's strength, hardening bone and muscle with servo-assisted overlays or hydraulic body-rigs._

**Mundane:** _70 credits – Rare (13)_ The fighter's Strength is increased by +1.

### Aortic Supercharger[​](#aortic-supercharger "Direct link to Aortic Supercharger")

**(Enfeebled Lasting Injury Table Result)**

_An aortic supercharger increases heart and organ function, granting a fighter exceptional stamina and the ability to shrug off injury._

**Mundane:** _65 credits – Rare (13)_ The fighter's Toughness is increased by +1.

# Gang Equipment | NecroRAW
Be it extra stashes of ammo, booby traps to guard their territory, or strange robotic sentinels to act as bodyguards and sentries, gangs employ many types of equipment. This section covers just a few.

Trading Post Gang Equipment[​](#trading-post-gang-equipment "Direct link to Trading Post Gang Equipment")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Ammo Cache[​](#ammo-cache "Direct link to Ammo Cache")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**60 Credits – Rare (8)**

Ammo caches are added to the gang's Stash, instead of being carried by a particular fighter. Immediately after the last of the fighters in the crew is set up at the start of a battle, the controlling player can choose to set up any ammo caches from their Stash. If the scenario has an attacker and a defender, and this gang is defending, roll a D6 for each of their ammo caches:

*   On a 1-4, they were not expecting the attackers and the caches cannot be used.
*   On a 5 or 6, they are lucky enough to have them to hand.

Each ammo cache must be set up within 1" of one of their fighters, and within their deployment zone if the scenario has one. It is then deleted from the gang's Stash. During the battle, ammo caches follow the rules given in [Scenario Rules: Ammo Cache](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/battlefield-set-up/scenario-rules#ammo-cache).

### Booby Traps (Frag, Gas & Melta)[​](#booby-traps-frag-gas--melta "Direct link to Booby Traps (Frag, Gas & Melta)")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**Frag – 20 Credits**  
**Gas – 40 Credits – Rare (8)**  
**Melta – 50 Credits – Rare (10)**

A booby trap is represented by a marker placed upon the battlefield at the start of the battle, after the battlefield has been set up but before deploying any fighters. If both gangs possess and wish to use booby traps, the defender or the winner of a roll-off (if there is no defender) places theirs first.

If any model, friendly or enemy, comes within 2" of a booby trap for any reason, they risk setting the booby trap off. Roll a D6. On a 1, the booby trap is a dud and is removed from the battlefield. On a 2 or 3, the booby trap does not go off but is left in place. On a 4, 5 or 6, the booby trap is triggered and will explode. The profiles for booby traps can be found in the [Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/booby-traps). The movement of a moving model is interrupted whilst this roll is resolved. If the booby trap does not go off, their movement continues after the roll is made. If the booby trap does go off, and the model is Pinned, Injured, Wrecked or Stalled as a result, their movement ends.

Any model can target a booby trap with ranged attacks. Doing so has a -1 modifier to the hit roll at Short range, or a -2 modifier at Long range. If the booby trap is hit, roll a D6:

*   On a 1-2, it is unaffected.
*   On a 3-4, it is immediately triggered.
*   On a 5-6, it is disarmed and removed.

### Isotropic Fuel Rod[​](#isotropic-fuel-rod "Direct link to Isotropic Fuel Rod")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**60 Credits – Rare (10)**

Power is life down in the underhive, keeping the lights on, running water stills and allowing for the cultivation of edible slimes. A fully charged fuel rod can turn a rad-washed waste into a fertile settlement, and the foundation for a burgeoning community.

A gang with an Isotropic Fuel Rod can use it to turn any Territory into a Settlement Territory. Doing so uses up the Isotropic Fuel Rod, so it should be deleted from the gang roster, and permanently changes the Territory.

### Mung Vase[​](#mung-vase "Direct link to Mung Vase")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**2D6x10 Credits – Rare (12)**

_Mung vases are extraordinarily rare collectors objects. Few hivers know where the exquisite vases originate, only that they can be worth astronomical sums of money to the right people. This knowledge is widespread enough that over the centuries, Necromunda has become flooded with millions of fake Mung vases, ranging from crudely fashioned knock-offs that wouldn't fool a blind sump-farmer, to exceptional facsimiles that are works of art in their own right._

A Mung Vase is a type of Status Item. However unlike other Status Items, rather than being given to a Leader or Champion to carry, the Mung Vase is kept in the gang's Stash. When a gang in possession of a Mung Vase recruits a Hired Gun, they can reduce the Hire Gun's cost by D6x10 credits, to a minimum of 10 credits. The vase is shown off as an example of the gang's wealth and success, and the Hired Gun believes that agreeing to a reduced fee now will earn them favour with this potentially prosperous employer. There is, however, a chance the Hired Gun will simply try to steal the vase when they leave! After a battle in which a Mung Vase was used to reduce the hiring cost of a Hired Gun, roll a D6. On a 1, both the Hired Gun and the vase disappear, never to be seen again. In the post-battle sequence of any battle, a gang can sell the vase. If they do, roll a D6 on the Mung Vase table to see what it is worth (players should resist the temptation to roll on this table unless their gang is attempting to sell a Mung Vase – you don't need to know your vase is a fake, ignorance is bliss!).

#### Mung Vase Table[​](#mung-vase-table "Direct link to Mung Vase Table")

  * Effect: A fine example of the counterfeiters' art. The vase nets the gang D6x20 credits.
*   D6  : 6
  * Type: Outstanding Fake?
  * Effect: Make an Intelligence test for the gang Leader. If they fail, count this result as an Impressive Fake. If they pass, they realise what they have just in time – add D6x50 to the gang's Stash.


Finally, if the gang Leader is killed and removed fromthe gang roster, the vase is lost too – no one else in the gang knows where the vase has been kept hidden!

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: The Book of Ruin_  
**Corpse Grinder only**

Only one fighter in a gang may carry a Corpse Grinder cult icon, this must be either the gang Leader or a Champion. A fighter cannot carry more than one icon. This symbol of blood and gore serves to work members of the cult into a frenzy, throwing themselves at their enemies in a crimson rage. If the fighter carrying this icon is Standing and Active, they may make the following action:

**Enrage:** All friendly fighters that are completely within 6" of this fighter, that have a Ready marker, and that are Standing and Active, add D3" to their Move characteristic until the End phase of this round.

# Personal Equipment | NecroRAW
[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

This section covers equipment carried by fighters to help them survive the rigours of battle and the harsh environments of the underhive and ash wastes. As well as the equipment readily available in the Trading Post, fighters make use of more outlandish items found in the badzones, and many are not above using illegal items secured through underhanded means.

### Archaeotech Device[​](#archaeotech-device "Direct link to Archaeotech Device")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**120 Credits – Rare (13)**

The underhive is filled with ancient treasures, strange objects from previous ages and wondrous technological devices Mankind has long since lost the ability to create. Of course, these rare pieces of archaeotech, as they are known, are hidden beneath thousands of years of debris and waste, and even should a fighter be fortunate enough to find a genuine archaeotech device, they still need to figure out how it works.

When a player buys an Archaeotech Device from the Trading Post, they won't know what it does. They must allocate it to one of their fighters and roll on the Archaeotech Device table to determine its type. If an Archaeotech Device is given to a different fighter in the gang for any reason, the new fighter must pass an Intelligence test the first time they wish to activate it. If they pass, they may use the device as normal from now on. If they fail, they must wait until their next battle to try to activate the device again.

#### Archaeotech Device Table[​](#archaeotech-device-table "Direct link to Archaeotech Device Table")



* D6: 1
  * Type: Dangerous
  * Effect: The fighter accidentally triggers the device as they're messing about with it. They immediately go into Recovery and the archaeotech is reduced to a pile of worthless molten slag.
* D6: 2
  * Type: Viewer
  * Effect: The fighter can use the device to view different places, shifting their perspective to almost any point, even if it's beyond closed doors and solid walls. A fighter with this device can make the Scan (Simple) action to place a Revealed marker on an enemy fighter within 18". If the fighter is selected to be a sentry, when they are activated, roll a D6 for them. On a 6, they automatically raise the alarm as they spot the enemy sneaking around.
* D6: 3
  * Type: Cutting Beam
  * Effect: The device can be used to focus a cutting beam of great power on a stationary object. Unfortunately, it's useless as a weapon because both the target and the fighter have to be perfectly still for the beam to focus, but it makes for a good can opener! A fighter with this device can make the Laser Cut (Double) action if they are within 1" of a door, loot casket or other damageable piece of terrain. This action inflicts a single automatic hit against the chosen target, resolved with Strength 8 and Damage 3.
* D6: 4
  * Type: Lifter
  * Effect: The device is a sophisticated form of suspensor which can negate or lessen gravity for its bearer, allowing them to float up or down for a limited period. When making a Move or Charge action, the fighter ignores all terrain, may move freely between levels without restriction, and can never fall. They may not, however, ignore impassable terrain or walls, and may not end their movement with their base overlapping an obstacle or another fighter's base.
* D6: 5
  * Type: Holo Projector
  * Effect: The device functions as a holo projector and can be used to make the fighter appear a short distance away from where they really are. This gives the fighter a 4+ field armour save. As soon as the saving throw is failed, the projector stops working for the rest of the battle. Also note that the holo projector is useless against close combat attacks and weapons with the Template or Blast traits.
* D6: 6
  * Type: Weapon
  * Effect: The device is a powerful and compact weapon. It is only pistol-sized but it is as effective as a much larger piece of ordnance. Roll a D6 to find out what it is:D6
  * Result
* D6: 1-2
  * Type: Boltgun
  * Effect: 
* D6: 3
  * Type: Flamer
  * Effect: 
* D6: 4
  * Type: Meltagun
  * Effect: 
* D6: 5
  * Type: Plasma gun
  * Effect: 
* D6: 6
  * Type: Grenade launcher with frag grenades.
  * Effect: 


The weapon has the standard profile for a weapon of its type but with the addition of the Sidearm trait. Because the weapon is compact and self- maintaining it can be used by anyone, not just Specialists, Champions or Leaders.

### Armoured Undersuit[​](#armoured-undersuit "Direct link to Armoured Undersuit")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**25 Credits – Rare (7)**

An armoured undersuit may be worn in addition to any armour type, with the exception of an armoured bodyglove. If a fighter is wearing an armoured undersuit, their save roll is improved by 1. For example, if they are wearing flak armour and an armoured undersuit, they would have a 5+ save, which would be increased to 4+ against Blasts. If a fighter does not already have a save roll, an armoured undersuit grants a 6+ save.

### Bio-Booster[​](#bio-booster "Direct link to Bio-Booster")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**35 Credits – Rare (8)**

The first time in each battle that an Injury roll is made for a fighter with a bio-booster, one less Injury dice is rolled. If only one dice was being rolled, two dice are rolled and the player controlling the fighter with the biobooster can discard one of them.

### Bio-Scanner[​](#bio-scanner "Direct link to Bio-Scanner")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**30 Credits – Rare (8)**

If a fighter with a bio-scanner is a sentry in a scenario that uses the Sentries special rule, they can attempt to spot attackers even if the attackers are not within their vision arc. In addition, the D6 roll to see whether a fighter is spotted has a +1 modifier (a natural 1 still fails).

### Blind Snake Pouch[​](#blind-snake-pouch "Direct link to Blind Snake Pouch")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**60 Credits – Rare (12)**

Sump shamans are strange underhive mystics believed to be able to commune with the spirits of the hive. Whether or not this is true, the fetishes they make are highly sought after and reputed to be able to protect a fighter from harm.

A fighter with a Blind Snake Pouch gains the Dodge skill. If they already have the Dodge skill then they will successfully dodge attacks on a D6 roll of 5 or 6 rather than just a roll of 6. In addition, when making a dodge against an attack made by a fighter using the [Overwatch](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/gang-fighters-and-their-weaponry/skills/#6-overwatch) skill, the dodge will succeed on a D6 roll of 4, 5 or 6.

### Cameleoline Cloak[​](#cameleoline-cloak "Direct link to Cameleoline Cloak")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**35 Credits – Rare (9)**

Cameleoline is a much sought-after material within the Imperium, and is commonly used by the armies of the Emperor for stealth and scout troops. On Necromunda, some examples of the material can be found in the underhive, stitched into more common clothing or as an extra layer on a cloak, allowing the wearer to seemingly vanish if they stand still. If the wearer of a Cameleoline cloak did not move during their activation, ranged attacks made against them suffer a -2 to hit until the start of their next activation.

### Chem-Synth[​](#chem-synth "Direct link to Chem-Synth")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**15 Credits – Rare (12)**

At the start of their activation, a Standing and Active or Standing and Engaged fighter with a chem-synth can choose to make an Intelligence test. If the test is passed, any Gas or Toxin weapons they use until the end of their activation are enhanced and the target's Toughness is treated as being 1 lower when resolving those attacks.

### Chrono-Crystal[​](#chrono-crystal "Direct link to Chrono-Crystal")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**500 Credits – Illegal (14)**

The opportunity to acquire one of Bald Bryen's Chronocrystals is vanishingly rare, and possession of such an item will not only result in the owner earning the eternal enmity of the infamous mayor of Rust Town, but may also lead to them crossing paths with the Ordo Chronos in the future (or, perhaps, in the past...). Certain scenario special rules will detail the ways in which a Chrono-crystal can be used.

### Cred Sniffer[​](#cred-sniffer "Direct link to Cred Sniffer")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**35 Credits – Rare (8)**

Cred Sniffers are modified auspexes created by enterprising archaeo-thieves. They literally sniff out the rare alloys in cred chits and direct the user to their location. If a fighter equipped with a Cred Sniffer was part of a battle and was not taken Out of Action or Prone and Seriously Injured, at the end of the battle they earn 4D6 credits for their gang. A gang can only benefit from the effects of one Cred Sniffer at a time.

### Cult Icon[​](#cult-icon "Direct link to Cult Icon")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Unlike other items of Wargear, a gang may only purchase a single Cult Icon. This item must be carried by a fighter with both the Gang Hierarchy (X) and Group Activation (X) special rules. When a fighter that is carrying a Cult Icon uses the Group Activation (X) special rule, they may activate one additional Ready friendly fighter, meaning that a fighter with the Group Activation (2) special rule may activate three additional fighters, whilst a fighter with the Group Activation (1) special rule may activate two additional fighters.

### Data-Thief[​](#data-thief "Direct link to Data-Thief")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**35 Credits – Illegal (10)**

Data-thief slates monitor enemy comms and farm useful information from Necromunda's various vox-nets. If a crew includes at least one fighter equipped with a Data-thief, at the start of the battle they can make their opponent randomly reveal one of their gang tactics.

### Dome Runner Map / Ratskin Map[​](#dome-runner-map--ratskin-map "Direct link to Dome Runner Map / Ratskin Map")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**100 Credits – Rare (9)**

Dome Runners often map out sections of the hive based on their extensive explorations. These maps are jealousy guarded by individual Dome Runners, often written in code and covered with strange symbols marking out hidden stashes or secret pathways to lost sections of the underhive. Rarely, one of these maps might fall into the hands of an underhive trader, though copies and fakes are common, some leading to great treasures, others perilous badzones.

Before a gang with a Dome Runner Map rolls to determine the scenario as part of the pre-battle sequence, they can declare they are using their Dome Runner Map. If both gangs have a Dome Runner Map, they should roll off to see whose gang gets to use theirs for this battle – capitalising on the map's information before their opponent can. The player then rolls on the Dome Runner Map table to see how valuable the information on it is. Note, once the type of map is determined, it remains the same, and provided it is worth something, a gang may use it again in the pre-battle sequence of subsequent battles.

#### Dome Runner Map Table[​](#dome-runner-map-table "Direct link to Dome Runner Map Table")



* D6: 1
  * Type: Fake
  * Effect: Instead of rolling for the scenario as normal, your opponent chooses the scenario for this battle. Remove the Dome Runner Map from your gang roster.
* D6: 2
  * Type: Worn and Incomplete
  * Effect: After making the roll to determine the scenario, you may add or subtract 1 from the result.
* D6: 3
  * Type: Treasure Map
  * Effect: Roll another D6. On a 1-5, the map is a Fake (see above). On a 6, it is a genuine treasure map. If your gang wins the scenario, they can add D6x20 credits to their Stash in addition to any other rewards.
* D6: 4
  * Type: Ancient and Faded
  * Effect: After making the roll to determine the scenario, you may add or subtract 2 from the result.
* D6: 5
  * Type: Secret Pathways
  * Effect: D3 fighters in your gang gain the Infiltrate skill for the duration of this scenario.
* D6: 6
  * Type: Recent and Accurate
  * Effect: After making the roll to determine the scenario, you may add or subtract up to 3 from the result.


### Drop Rig[​](#drop-rig "Direct link to Drop Rig")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**10 Credits**

An Active fighter with a drop rig can make the Descend (Basic) action while they are within 1" of the edge of a platform:

**Descend (Basic):** The fighter makes a move of up to 3" horizontally and up to 12" vertically. Any vertical movement must be downwards, i.e., towards the ground.

### Falsehood[​](#falsehood "Direct link to Falsehood")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**40 Credits – Rare (9)**

When this device is activated it projects a distortion field that changes the wearer's appearance, making them appear as someone else. A fighter equipped with a Falsehood cannot be targeted by ranged or melee attacks or enemy psychic powers, and will not cause the alarm to be raised if spotted by a sentry in a battle using the Sneak Attack rules. These effects last until the fighter makes a melee or ranged attack, uses a psychic power on an enemy fighter, or until the End phase of the second round. At this point their suspicious or openly hostile acts give them away, the illusion is dispelled and the hood has no further effect.

### Filter Plugs[​](#filter-plugs "Direct link to Filter Plugs")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**10 Credits - Common**

If a fighter with filter plugs is hit by a weapon with the Gas trait, their Toughness is increased by 1 for the purposes of the roll to see whether they are affected. Filter plugs are one use; if a fighter uses them during a battle, they are removed from their Fighter card when the battle ends.

### Frenzon Collar[​](#frenzon-collar "Direct link to Frenzon Collar")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**30 Credits – Rare (9)**

_A method of control, the Frenzon collar is usually found clamped around the necks of unwilling penal troopers, where its cocktail of combat drugs drives them into battle at the behest of their masters. Underhive gangers sometimes wear these collars willingly into combat, or as part of a dare._

A fighter equipped with a Frenzon collar is considered to be permanently under the effects of Frenzon (see [Chems: Frenzon](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/chems#frenzon)).

In addition, each collar comes with a master motivator. At the start of the battle, the player must decide if their Leader or one of their Champions is carrying the master motivator. When the Leader or Champion with the master motivator makes a group activation, they may include models wearing Frenzon collars (up to the normal number of fighters they may group activate) regardless of where they are on the battlefield. Note that if a gang includes more than one fighter equipped with a Frenzon collar, they will only ever have a single master motivator which governs all collars in the gang.

### Forged Guilder Seal[​](#forged-guilder-seal "Direct link to Forged Guilder Seal")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**55 Credits – Illegal (11)**

Truly decent forged documents are a rarity in the underhive, and ones good enough for a ganger to pass themselves off as a Guilder even more so – though they do exist. Only the boldest criminals pretend to be Guilders, however, for the consequences of being discovered and caught involves a long and painful execution. When a fighter with a Forged Guilder Seal visits the Trading Post, they reduce the Rarity of Items by 2. In addition, the prices of any items they buy are reduced by 3D6 credits to a minimum of 10 credits. However, if they roll a double 1 or double 6 when reducing the price of an item, they have been discovered. The item is bought as normal, however, the seal is then removed from their Fighter card, and the fighter's gang are declared Outlaws.

### Grapnel Launcher[​](#grapnel-launcher "Direct link to Grapnel Launcher")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**25 Credits**

An Active fighter with a grapnel launcher can make the following action:

**Grapnel (Double):** The fighter can move up to 12" in a straight line, in any direction. This move can take them to a different level, as long as they do not move through any terrain.

### Grav-Chute[​](#grav-chute "Direct link to Grav-Chute")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

If a fighter with a grav-chute falls or jumps down to a lower level, they do not suffer any damage – they simply move down without any rolls being made.

### Guilder Cartograph[​](#guilder-cartograph "Direct link to Guilder Cartograph")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _The Book of Peril, p91_  
**70 Credits – Rare (11)**

_Guilder cartographs are detailed maps of the trails between settlements, showing local hazards as well as safe campsites. Up-to-date cartographs are much sought after by travellers, as they mean the difference between reaching their destination alive or ending up as one more corpse in the underhive._

While a gang is in possession of a Guilder Cartograph, they may alter the Environment when using the Badzones Environments Events Cards or chart (on page 50). After determining the Environment at the beginning of the game, the gang with the Cartograph may immediately discard it and generate a new Environment. If both players have a Cartograph, they should roll off to see who gets to use theirs for this scenario.

In addition to changing the Environment, Cartographs often show the location of Guilder supply caches. During deployment, a gang with a Cartograph can place four loot caskets anywhere on the battlefield.

Of course, the underhive is changing, and maps can become outdated. After each game in which a gang used their Guilder Cartograph, their player should roll a D6. On a 4+, the information it contains is still good, otherwise it is of no further use and should be deleted from the gang roster.

### Halo Device[​](#halo-device "Direct link to Halo Device")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**250 Credits – Illegal (14)**

From the forlorn regions beyond the edge of the Imperium, intrepid Rogue Traders sometimes bring back strange objects. Known as Halo devices, these alien artefacts are often imbued with ancient energies, able to sustain their owners even beyond death, though often at a cost to others. When a fighter equipped with a Halo device suffers a Lasting Injury (including Memorable Death), their player can choose another member of their gang to suffer all the effects of the Lasting Injury instead (treat the fighter equipped with the Halo device as having suffered the Out Cold result instead). Note that if the fighter was taken Out of Action they are still removed from the battle, while the fighter chosen to suffer the Lasting Injury remains on the battlefield unless the result was a 61-66, in which case they are removed.

### Harrier-Skulls[​](#harrier-skulls "Direct link to Harrier-Skulls")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**40 Credits – Rare (8)**

With every innovation in combat there is usually a counter-innovation to defeat it. Harrier-skulls are a kind of servo-skull designed to act as decoys for Grapplehawks and other hunting beasts. If an Exotic Beast wants to make an attack against a fighter equipped with Harrier-skulls, it must first pass an Intelligence test – otherwise the Attack action fails and is wasted. If the owner of the Exotic Beast is within 3" of the target of the attack, the beast may use its owner's Intelligence for the test instead.

### Hexagrammic Fetish[​](#hexagrammic-fetish "Direct link to Hexagrammic Fetish")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**35 Credits – Rare (10)**

Badzone peddlers and sumphole wise women often sell charms and fetishes 'guaranteed' to offer protection. The truly astonishing thing is some of these charms actually work! When a fighter buys a Hexagrammic Fetish, they must roll a D6. On a 1, the fetish is rubbish, though the fighter can sell it on to an unsuspecting underhiver for 3D6 credits. On a 2-5, it has some power, and if a Psyker targets the fighter with a psychic power, the Psyker suffers a -1 to their Willpower test. On a 6, the fetish has some real juice; it works as above except the Psyker will suffer a -3 to their Willpower test.

### Holochromatic Field[​](#holochromatic-field "Direct link to Holochromatic Field")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**100 Credits – Illegal (9)**

A Holochromatic field surrounds its wearer in an aura of scintillating colours. Ranged attacks against a fighter with a Holochromatic field suffer a -2 to hit, while melee attacks against them suffer a -1 to hit. Each time the fighter is targeted with an attack, roll a D6. On a 1, the Holochromatic field has been drained and has no effect for the rest of this battle. Fighters wearing an active Holochromatic field count as always having a revealed marker on them in scenarios using the Pitch Black rules. A Holochromatic field cannot be combined with Cameleoline Cloaks or similar devices that make the wearer harder to see.

### Industrial Respirator[​](#industrial-respirator "Direct link to Industrial Respirator")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**30 Credits – Rare (7)**

Respirators are a common sight in the underhive, offering some measure of protection against airborne hazards. Most are ancient things, their filters clogged with years of filth and barely functioning. Sometimes gangers might get their hands on a batch of newly minted respirators, and even some of the rare heavy industrial breathing apparatus reserved for Helmawr's personal guard or outerhive work crews.

An Industrial Respirator adds 3 to a fighter's Toughness, or 4 if combined with a Hazard Suit, against attacks from weapons with the Gas trait. In addition, an Industrial Respirator contains a limited air supply. Once per battle, when a fighter with an Industrial Respirator is activated, they can declare they are using its air supply. Until the fighter is activated again, they gain immunity to Gas attacks, can act normally while on fire (though they may still take damage) and may ignore effects keyed to breathing or air quality.

### Lho Sticks[​](#lho-sticks "Direct link to Lho Sticks")

**5 Credits**

A fighter equipped with lho sticks is considered to be 'cool' by the more gullible members of their gang. Any friendly fighter with an Intelligence characteristic of 8+ or worse may use this fighter's Cool characteristic instead of their own if they are within 6" and line of sight of this fighter.

### Lock-Punch[​](#lock-punch "Direct link to Lock-Punch")

**10 Credits**

Lock-punches are crude pneumatic devices used to smash locks out of doors and force them open. A fighter equipped with a lock-punch can use it when they are taking the [Force Door (Basic)](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/the-rules/game-structure/the-action-phase/fighter-actions#force-door-basic) action to add 4 to their Strength. Doors opened with lock-punches are permanently damaged and must be removed from the battlefield.

### Magnacles[​](#magnacles "Direct link to Magnacles")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023), originates in [The Book of Judgement: The Black Market Trading Post](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/book-of-judgement-the-black-market-trading-post)_  
**20 Credits**

Used by both the Adeptus Arbites and local Enforcers across the Imperium, Magnacles are magnetic shackles for locking prisoners in place. A fighter equipped with Magnacles can try to lock them onto an enemy in base contact as an Attack (Basic) action. The target must make an Initiative test to avoid the attack. If this test is failed they are locked in place and cannot move, cannot make ranged attacks and can only make melee attacks at -2 to hit. The target can attempt to free themselves by performing a Break Bonds (Double) action. Roll 2D6. If the result is equal or lower than their Strength then they have freed themselves, otherwise they remain trapped.

Malefic Artefacts are objects of the Warp or those that have lingered in the hands of corrupted individuals. When a player buys a Malefic Artefact from the Trading Post, they won't know what it does. They must allocate it to one of their fighters and roll a D6 on the Malefic Artefacts table to determine its type. If a Malefic Artefact is later given to a different fighter in the gang for any reason, the new fighter must pass an Intelligence test the first time they wish to activate it. If they pass, they may use the artefact as normal from now on. If they fail, they wait until their next battle to try to activate the artefact again.

#### Malefic Artefacts Table[​](#malefic-artefacts-table "Direct link to Malefic Artefacts Table")



* D6: 1
  * Type: Cursed Artefact
  * Effect: The fighter accidentally triggers the artefact as they're messing about with it. The Malefic Artefact mysteriously vanishes and the fighter begins their next battle with the Insane condition.
* D6: 2
  * Type: Whisper Vox
  * Effect: Hidden truths issue forth from the artefact, informing its bearer as to the intentions of those around them. The fighter gains the Overwatch skill. If they already have the Overwatch skill, they can take the Aim (Basic) action in addition to the Shoot (Basic) action when using this skill.
* D6: 3
  * Type: Void Gate
  * Effect: The artefact is a gateway to a dark yawning void that the fighter may open to sap the strength of those around them. The fighter can perform the Unleash the Void (Double) action. If they take this action, for the remainder of the round, all other fighters within 6" of them can only take a single action during their activation.
* D6: 4
  * Type: Aetheric Lantern
  * Effect: When the artefact is activated, it acts as a beacon to the denizens of the Warp who would feast upon the dead and dying. The fighter can perform the Ignite Aetheric Lantern (Double) action. If they do, any Prone and Seriously Injured fighter within 12" of them must pass a Toughness check or go Out of Action.
* D6: 5
  * Type: Chronoscope
  * Effect: Time works differently around the artefact, sometimes speeding up, sometimes slowing down. When the fighter activates, roll a D6. On a 1, they may take no actions this round. On a 2-5, they can take an extra action this round. On a 6, after they complete their activation they may be placed anywhere within 12" of their current location.
* D6: 6
  * Type: Terror Telepathica
  * Effect: Dire thoughts are projected from the artefact driving all those nearby mad. The fighter gains immunity to the Insane condition. Any other fighter that activates within 6" of the fighter must immediately pass a Willpower test or gain the Insane condition.

**100 Credits – Illegal (12)**

Adeptus Mechanicus Tech-Priests use Mnemonic Inload Spikes for the swift transfer of data from one cortex to the next. Each spike contains potential secrets and skills that the user can inload directly to their brain, though for those without the proper cybernetic interfaces the process can be fatal. When a gang buys an inload spike, they must choose one of their fighters to attempt to use its data. The chosen fighter must immediately roll on the Lasting Injuries table (re-roll any results of Bitter Enmity or Captured). If the fighter is still alive after making this roll they gain one skill of their choice from Agility, Brawn, Combat, Cunning, Ferocity, Leadership, Savant or Shooting. The spike is then used up and removed from the gang's stash.

A model with photo-goggles can attack through smoke clouds, increases the value of X" in the Visibility (X") rule by 9" and may gain other benefits in low light conditions, depending upon the scenario. In addition, if they are hit by a Flash weapon, add 1 to the result of any test to see whether they become subject to the Blind condition.

Commonly carried by Palanite Enforcers, a model that is equipped with a photo-lumen increases the value of X" in the Visibility (X") rule by 9". However, when the Visibility (X") rules are in effect, a fighter equipped with a photo-lumen cannot be Hidden – they are instead always subject to the Revealed condition due to the bright light emanating from their gear.

### Psi-Grub[​](#psi-grub "Direct link to Psi-Grub")

**50 Credits – Illegal (12)**

Whenever a fighter with a Psi-grub uses a psychic power or is the target of a psychic power, place a Psi-grub token on their Fighter card after working out the effects of the power. Once there is at least one Psi-grub token on the fighter's card, they can attempt to use the Psi-grub whenever they manifest a psychic power.

To trigger the Psi-grub, the fighter makes a Tap Psi-grub (Basic) Action and rolls a D6. If the result is equal to or lower than the number of Psi-grub tokens on their Fighter card, the Psi-grub is triggered, otherwise there is no effect. When the Psi-grub is triggered, remove all Psi-grub tokens from the fighter's card and immediately use one of the fighter's psychic powers just as if they had taken a Wyrd Power (X) action (see [Using Wyrd Powers](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/the-rules/psykers/#using-wyrd-powers)). This action does not require the fighter to make a Willpower test.

If there are ever six tokens on the fighter's card, the Psi-grub immediately explodes! Remove all the tokens and the Psi-grub from the fighter's card and roll an Injury dice for the fighter.

A fighter can use a Sanctioning Writ to place a Bounty on any member of a Law Abiding gang (see [Claim Bounties](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/the-rules/the-post-battle-sequence#claim-bounties)). This Bounty remains in place until it is fulfilled, the targeted fighter dies or the campaign comes to an end. A Sanctioning Writ can only be used once, after which it is lost, and a fighter can only have one Bounty on their head at a time.

### Second Best[​](#second-best "Direct link to Second Best")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**15 Credits – Common**

Second Best, as the name suggests, is what you drink when you don't have the creds for anything better. The exact contents of a bottle of Second Best vary from settlement to settlement, but are usually a cocktail of drinking-hole dregs, fermented fungi and gun oil (to make it go down smooth!). A few swigs of Second Best will bolster a fighter's courage, but too much can lead to blindness, unconsciousness and even death.

A fighter with a bottle of Second Best can make the Take a Swig (Simple) action. After they take this action, roll a D6. On a 1, 2 or 3, the bottle is empty; remove it from the fighter's card. Every time a fighter makes this action, place an Intoxicated marker on their card and remove one of their Flesh Wounds (if they have any). Intoxicated markers remain until the end of the battle. The effects of the booze are dependent on how many markers they have on their card.

#### Second Best Intoxication Table[​](#second-best-intoxication-table "Direct link to Second Best Intoxication Table")



* Intoxicated Markers: 1
  * Effect: Feeling Good: -1 to ranged attack hit rolls, +1 to the result of Cool tests.
* Intoxicated Markers: 2
  * Effect: Getting Unsteady: -2 to ranged attack hit rolls, +2 to the result of Cool tests. If the fighter makes two Move actions in a row, they must pass an Initiative test after completing the second action or become Prone and Pinned.
* Intoxicated Markers: 3+
  * Effect: Blind Drunk: -3 to ranged attack hit rolls and -1 to melee attack hit rolls, +3 to the result of Cool tests. When the fighter makes a Move action, instead of using the fighter's Movement characteristic, move the fighter D6" in a direction determined by the Scatter dice.


### Servo Harness[​](#servo-harness "Direct link to Servo Harness")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Usually seen in manufactoria, cargo haulage and storage depots, a servo harness greatly enhances the wearer's strength and endurance, taking the load off their own body and onto itself. Unsurprisingly, many gang fighters find these benefits appealing in their line of work.

**Partial:** _130 credits – Rare (12)_ A fighter wearing a partial servo harness gains a +2 modifier to their Strength characteristic and a +1 modifier to their Toughness characteristic. This may take them above their maximum characteristics but it is not a permanent increase and will be lost should the servo harness be lost or cease to function for any reason. Additionally, a fighter wearing a partial servo harness gains the benefits of suspensors on any Unwieldy weapon they carry. However, a fighter wearing a partial servo harness reduces their Movement and Initiative by 1. This item cannot be combined with a servo claw or any other type of servo harness.

**Full:** _160 credits – Rare (12)_ A fighter wearing a full servo harness gains all of the benefits of a partial servo harness, but without the negative modifiers to Movement and Initiative. This item cannot be combined with a servo claw or any other type of servo harness.

Once per battle, a fighter with a stimm-slug stash can use it at the start of their activation. Immediately discard one Flesh Wound from the fighter's card, if any are present. Until the end of the round, the fighter's Move, Strength and Toughness characteristics are each increased by 2. At the start of the End phase, roll a D6. On a 1, the stimm overload is too much – roll an Injury dice and apply the result to the fighter.

_Underhivers are nothing if not resourceful when it comes to repurposing gear for their needs. The suspensor harness is such a device, a collection of belts and components from a heavy weapon suspensor array allowing the wearer to carry excessive amounts of equipment. While Guilder slaves and Badzones prospectors might use them to carry heavy loads, gangers mainly use them to sling extra weapons on their back._

A fighter equipped with a suspensor harness may carry four weapons rather than three, while a Hired Gun Bounty Hunter with a suspensor harness may carry six weapons rather than five. As usual, weapons marked on the Equipment List with (\*) take up the space of two weapons.

**45 Credits – Illegal (13)**

Threadneedle worms are a deadly bio-weapon able to ravage an area of life in seconds. The lethality of Threadneedle worms makes them an ideal weapon of last resort for gangers who don't care about collateral damage.

A fighter equipped with Threadneedle worms can unleash them by taking the **Can of Worms (Basic)** action. Threadneedle worms can only be used once, after which they are removed from the fighter's card. When Threadneedle worms are used, roll a D6 on the Threadneedle Worms table.

#### Threadneedle Worms Table[​](#threadneedle-worms-table "Direct link to Threadneedle Worms Table")



*   D6  : 1
  * Result: The Worms Turn: Roll an Injury dice for the fighter using the Threadneedle Worms.

  * Result: A Few More Live Worms: Place a 5" Blast marker anywhere within D6" of the fighter, then place two additional 5" Blast markers so they are in contact with the first marker. Roll an Injury dice for each fighter under any of the markers.
*   D6  : 6
  * Result: A Can Full of Worms: Roll an Injury dice for every enemy fighter on the battlefield, treating Out of Action results as Seriously Injured.

Additionally, when a fighter equipped with web solvent assists a fighter subject to the Webbed condition with a Recovery test, roll an extra two Injury dice and choose which one to apply.

### Wild Snake[​](#wild-snake "Direct link to Wild Snake")

**30 Credits - Common**

About the 'finest' booze around, Wild Snake is the go-to drink for underhivers with creds in their pocket and an iron liver. Each bottle contains the skinned and pickled remains of a 'snake', giving the liquor both its name and a sharp bitter taste on account of the snake venom. Gangs prize bottles of Wild Snake both because it is a quick and easy path to inebriation, but also because of the fabled 'Snake Courage' it can imbue!

A fighter with a bottle of Wild Snake can make the Take a Swig (Simple) action. After they make this action, roll a D6. On a 1 or 2, the bottle is empty; remove it from the fighter's card. Every time a fighter makes this action, place an Intoxicated marker on their card and remove one of their Flesh Wounds (if they have any). Intoxicated markers remain until the end of the battle. The effects of the booze are dependent on how many markers they have on their card:

#### Wild Snake Intoxication Table[​](#wild-snake-intoxication-table "Direct link to Wild Snake Intoxication Table")

**80 Credits – Illegal (12)**

A Xenoculum can represent any number of esoteric alien devices, the true purposes of which only becomes apparent through experimentation. When a player buys a Xenoculum from the Trading Post, they won't know what it does. They must allocate it to one of their fighters and roll a D6 on the Xenoculum table to determine its type. If a Xenoculum is later given to a different fighter in the gang for any reason, the new fighter must pass an Intelligence test the first time they wish to activate it. If they pass, they may use the device as normal from now on. If they fail, they must wait until their next battle to try to activate the device again.

#### Xenoculum Table[​](#xenoculum-table "Direct link to Xenoculum Table")



* D6: 1
  * Type: Alien Trap
  * Effect: The fighter accidentally triggers the Xenoculum as they're messing about with it. They immediately go into recovery and the Xenoculum is reduced to a collection of junk.
* D6: 2
  * Type: Xenos Claws
  * Effect: The Xenoculum moulds itself to the fighter's hands, lengthening into a pair of lethal claws. The fighter's unarmed attacks become S+2 D2 and gain the Power trait. While the fighter is equipped with the Xenoculum, any attacks they make with ranged weapons suffer a -2 to hit.
* D6: 3
  * Type: Ghost Form
  * Effect: The Xenoculum is a powerful transmatter convertor, allowing its user to slip out of sequence with reality for short periods. Whenever the fighter activates, they can enter ghost form. This state persists until their next activation. While in ghost form, the fighter ignores all terrain, the effects of falling and all attacks with the exception of psychic powers. However, they cannot make attacks themselves or interact with their environment in any way. Each time the fighter enters ghost form, they must roll a D6. On a 4+, the Xenoculumhas expended its charge and cannot be used again during the battle but will recharge in time for the next battle.
* D6: 4
  * Type: Horror Aura
  * Effect: A subliminal animalistic howl constantly screams forth from the Xenoculumand only its user is immune to its effects. Whenever the fighter activates, each other fighter, friend or foe, within 6" must make a Nerve test or become Broken.
* D6: 5
  * Type: Alien Chem-factory
  * Effect: Strange mechanisms concoct alien chems within the Xenoculum, dispensing them as the fighter desires. The fighter rolls two extra Injury dice when making Recovery rolls, or assisting another Prone and Seriously Injured fighter in the Recovery phase, and chooses the dice they wish to take effect. In addition, in the post-battle sequence, one member of the fighter's crew can make a Medical Escort action for free.
* D6: 6
  * Type: Brain Booster
  * Effect: A cranial spike allows the Xenoculum to be affixed to the fighter's brain, greatly boosting their cognitive function. The fighter adds 5 to the dice roll when making an Intelligence test. In addition, each time the fighter would gain Experience, they gain one additional point of Experience.

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: The Aranthian Succession – Vault of Temenos_  
**Van Saar only**

Once per activation, a fighter equipped with Arachni-rig jump boosters may choose to use them when they perform either a Move (Simple) or a Charge (Double) action. When they do so they add 3" to their Movement characteristic for the duration of the action.

When a fighter moves with the aid of Arachni-rig jump boosters, up to half of their total movement may be made vertically, allowing the fighter to move between levels and even to move over impassable terrain if they have sufficient movement to do so. However, should the fighter's movement end in the air, i.e., if the fighter does not have sufficient movement to land safely on a level surface, they will fall the remaining distance (note that, if this distance is 2" or less, the fighter will count as jumping down).

Should a fighter use Arachni-rig jump boosters when making a Charge (Double) action, for the duration of this activation they may apply both a +1 modifier to each Hit roll they make and a +1 modifier to their Strength characteristic.

Grav-cutters In The Ash Wastes

When founding a gang for an Ash Wastes Campaign, [grav-cutters](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/personal-equipment#grav-cutter) count as Wargear that grants the Mounted condition. However, grav-cutters may still be used in battles that do not allow Wargear that grants the Mounted condition (note this does not allow ash waste grav-cutters to be used in these battles).

A fighter equipped with an ash waste grav-cutter increases their Movement characteristic by 2" and becomes subject to the Mounted condition.

**Anti-grav Platform:** A fighter equipped with an ash waste grav-cutter may ignore all terrain, move freely between levels without restriction, never falls and can move over enemy fighters, ignoring the 1" rule. They may not, however, ignore impassable terrain and may not end their movement with their base overlapping an obstacle or within 1" of an enemy fighter's base.

Additionally, a fighter equipped with an Ash Waste Grav-cutter is not able to make the best use of cover. To represent this, when an enemy fighter shoots at a fighter equipped with an ash waste grav-cutter, any negative modifiers that may apply to the hit roll due to cover are reduced by 1.

**Hands Free:** A fighter equipped with an ash waste grav-cutter ignores the Hands Full rule due to the Mounted condition.

**Auto-gyro Stabilisation:** A fighter equipped with an Ash Waste Grav-cutter applies a +2 modifier to the Initiative test to avoid being pinned when hit by attempting to perform the Stand Up (Basic) action.

*   If the fighter loses a wound as a result of the [battlefield conditions](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/battlefield-set-up/generating-ash-wastes-battlefield-conditions) roll a D6; on a 5+ they ignore the effect and do not lose a wound.

**Words of Wrath (Basic):** This fighter reads aloud from the Book of the Redemption. Until the End phase of this round, any friendly House Cawdor fighter that is within 6" of this fighter when their activation starts may either re-roll the D3 when performing a Charge action, or may re-roll a single roll of a natural 1 when making a Hit roll.

### Bomb Delivery Rats[​](#bomb-delivery-rats "Direct link to Bomb Delivery Rats")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: House of Faith_  
**Cawdor only, 65 Credits**

A fighter equipped with bomb delivery rats may deploy one per turn to carry a single grenade of a type that fighter is equipped with by performing a Prime Bomb Rat (Basic) action. When a bomb delivery rat is deployed, make an Ammo roll for the grenade used as if it had been used normally. The fighter may run out of grenades before they run out of rats!

When the bomb delivery rat is deployed, place it so that the edge of its base is touching that of the fighter and make an Intelligence check for the fighter. If the check is passed, the fighter may choose the direction in which the rat moves. If the check is failed, the rat will move in a direction determined by rolling a Scatter dice. In either case, the rat may move up to 6". Bomb delivery rats ignore all terrain when moving, except any that would normally be impassable, such as walls. They suffer no penalties for climbing, they will never fall, and they may freely leap any gap of 2" or less. Wider gaps are considered impassable.

A bomb delivery rat is not a fighter and may pass within 1" of other models. Should the rat end its movement within 1" of, or in base to base contact with, a fighter, friend or enemy, or another bomb delivery rat, roll a D6. On a 2+, the grenade will go off. On a 1, the grenade proves to be a dud and the rat vanishes into the darkness to dwell upon its good fortune. In either case, the rat is removed from play.

At the start of every subsequent round, after rolling for Priority but before activating any fighters, if the bomb delivery rat has not exploded then it will activate again. Check to see if it is within 9" of the fighter that deployed it. If it is, and if that fighter is Standing and Active or Prone and Pinned, make an Intelligence check for the fighter. If this is passed, the rat will immediately move up to 6" in a direction of the controlling player's choosing. If it is beyond 9", the Intelligence check is failed, the fighter is Standing and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured or if the fighter has been taken Out of Action, then the rat will move 6" in a direction determined by rolling a Scatter dice. Should the rat end its movement within 1" of a fighter, friend or enemy, or another bomb delivery rat, roll a D6. On a 2+, the grenade will go off. On a 1, the grenade proves to be a dud. In either case, the rat is removed from play.

Any fighter may attempt to shoot at a bomb delivery rat or make a melee attack against one as if it were an enemy fighter. However, there is always an additional -1 modifier on any hit roll made against a bomb delivery rat. If the rat is hit, roll a D6. On a 4+, the grenade goes off. On a 1-3, the grenade does not go off. In either case, once a bomb delivery rat has been hit by a shooting or melee attack, it is removed from play.

_Crafted by the best Escher chymists, the camoelean elixir combines with the drinker's epidermal layers to create an almost perfect camouflage, especially if the user remains perfectly still or is not encumbered by heavy weapons or armour._

A fighter equipped with camoelean elixir may drink it at the start of any of their activations. For the remainder of the battle all ranged hit rolls against the fighter suffer a -2 modifier, while close combat hit rolls suffer a -1 modifier. Additionally, if the fighter is not carrying a weapon with the Unwieldy trait and has a 5+ or worse armour save (not counting field armour), or if they did not move during their previous activation, they may only be targeted by a ranged attack if they are within 6" of the attacker.

**[Spire Black Market](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/arbitrator-tools/apocrypha-optional-rules/blood-in-the-spire#spire-black-market) only, 250 Credits – Illegal (14)**

_A rare example of conversion field technology, draconic scales incorporate dozens of tiny energy fields layered within a dermal body suit. Often worn under armour, it is proof against most weapons, negating their penetrative powers._

A fighter equipped with draconic scales cannot have their armour save modified or negated by any rule or trait.

### Grav-Cutter[​](#grav-cutter "Direct link to Grav-Cutter")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: House of Artifice_  
**Van Saar only**

A fighter equipped with a grav-cutter increases their Movement characteristic by 2", ignores all terrain, may move freely between levels without restriction, can never fall, and may move over enemy fighters, ignoring the 1" rule. They may not, however, ignore impassable terrain and may not end their movement with their base overlapping an obstacle or within 1" of another fighter's base.

When a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter is hit by a ranged attack, they do not become Prone and Pinned. However, a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter is unable to perform a Take Cover (Basic) action, nor can they voluntarily become Prone and Pinned for any other reason. In addition, a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter is not able to make the best use of cover. To represent this, when an enemy fighter shoots at a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter, any negative modifiers that may apply to the hit roll due to cover are reduced by 1.

Should a fighter equipped with a grav-cutter ever become Prone for any other reason (due to being Seriously Injured and then recovering, for example), they are unable to make a Stand Up (Basic) action and must instead make a Stand Up (Double) action, regardless of any other special rules or skills that may otherwise affect their ability to stand up (the Spring Up skill, for example).

#### Fly By Attacks[​](#fly-by-attacks "Direct link to Fly By Attacks")

A fighter equipped with a grav-cutter is able to use its speed and bulk to strike down enemy fighters as they pass them by. A fighter equipped with a grav-cutter may perform the following action:

**Hit & Run (Basic):** This fighter may move a distance up to their Movement characteristic, exactly as if they were making a Move (Simple) action. If, during the course of this movement, the fighter passes over any enemy fighters, nominate one of those fighters to be the target of a single attack, representing this fighter attempting to strike them a glancing blow with the grav-cutter. Make a single hit roll by making a WS check as normal. If this check is passed, resolve a Strength 4, AP -, Damage 1 hit against the target, as if made by a weapon with both the Concussion and Knockback traits.

### Jump Booster[​](#jump-booster "Direct link to Jump Booster")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: House of Iron_  
**Orlock only**

Once per activation, a fighter equipped with a jump booster may choose to use it when they make either a Move (Simple) action or a Charge (Double) action. When a jump booster is used, it may be used in one of two ways, chosen by the controlling player:

*   The fighter may use the jump booster in 'safe mode', allowing them to add 3" to their Movement characteristic for the duration of this action.
*   The fighter may 'overcharge' the jump booster, allowing them to add D3+3" to their Movement characteristic for the duration of this action. However, doing so is not without risk, and should a natural 1 be rolled when rolling the dice, something has gone wrong and the jump booster will malfunction. The fighter does not move at all, and instead immediately becomes Prone and Pinned.

When a fighter moves with the aid of a jump booster, up to half of their total movement may be made vertically, allowing the fighter to move between levels and even to move over impassable terrain if they have sufficient movement to do so. However, should the fighter's movement end in the air, i.e., if the fighter does not have sufficient movement to land safely on a level surface, they will fall the remaining distance (note that, if this distance is 2" or less, the fighter will count as jumping down).

Should a fighter use a jump booster when making a Charge (Double) action, for the duration of this activation they may apply both a +1 modifier to each Hit roll they make and a +1 modifier to their Strength characteristic.

#### Hazardous Equipment[​](#hazardous-equipment "Direct link to Hazardous Equipment")

Using a jump booster is not without its risks, and this is never more true than when the user is attempting to use flame weapons or lob grenades! To represent this added danger, during any activation in which a fighter equipped with a jump booster uses it when making a Move (Simple) action, any weapons they are armed with that have either the Grenade or Template trait will also gain the Unstable trait. Once the fighter's activation ends, this rule ceases to apply.

### Mirror Aegis[​](#mirror-aegis "Direct link to Mirror Aegis")

**[Spire Black Market](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/arbitrator-tools/apocrypha-optional-rules/blood-in-the-spire#spire-black-market) only, 125 Credits – Illegal (12)**

_A mirror aegis is typical of the noble trickery common to the spire. The field projects an image of the wearer to a nearby location, drawing away enemies or getting them to turn their backs before the wearer strikes._

The first time a fighter equipped with a mirror aegis is hit by an attack (before wound rolls or armour saves are made) roll a D6. On a 1 resolve the attack as normal, then roll again the next time the fighter is hit by an attack. On a 2+ the attack is negated and the fighter may be placed anywhere within 6" of its current location and the mirror aegis cannot be used again this battle.

### Proximity Auspex[​](#proximity-auspex "Direct link to Proximity Auspex")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: The Aranthian Succession – Ruins of Jardlan_  
**Exclusive**

A fighter equipped with a proximity auspex can take the Scan For Threats (Basic) action.

**Scan For Threats (Basic):** Select an enemy model within 24". They become Revealed until the end of the current round.

### Psychofamile Pheromone[​](#psychofamile-pheromone "Direct link to Psychofamile Pheromone")

_Perfumes, incense and aromas fill the gilded halls of the spire, many crafted to sway the emotions or minds of those who smell them. Psychofamile pheromones work to make those close to the wearer see them as a loved one – usually just before the wearer drives a knife into their chest._

When a model attempts to target a fighter equipped with psychofamile pheromones with a ranged or close combat attack whilst they are within 3" of them (including attacks made as part of a Charge (Double) action) they must first make a Willpower test. If the test is passed, the attack is resolved as normal. If the test is failed, no attack is made and the action is wasted.

### Psychomancer's Harness[​](#psychomancers-harness "Direct link to Psychomancer's Harness")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: House of Shadow_  
**Delaque only**

This strange form of servo harness combines familiar underhive technology with the mysterious psychic sciences of House Delaque. Plugging directly into the wearer’s mind mechanically and psychically, the wearer’s strength and agility is greatly enhanced by the harness.

A fighter wearing a psychomancer’s harness increases their Move characteristic by +2". Additionally, when this fighter climbs, the vertical distance they move is not halved. In other words, they always count as climbing up or down a ladder.

A fighter wearing a psychomancer’s harness is automatically equipped with [paired psychomantic claws](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/close-combat-weapons#paired-psychomantic-claws). However, the fighter can only be equipped with a maximum of two weapons purchased from those listed in their entry (rather than the usual three) and may not be equipped with any weapons marked with an asterisk (\*), or any weapons with the Unwieldy trait.

**Redemptionists only**

Fanatical followers of the Redemption often wear elaborate dress and headgear that not only gives them a sinister and threatening silhouette, but that quite literally burns with the fires of the Emperor's wrath! Any attacks made with weapons that have the Melee or Versatile trait (including unarmed attacks) carried by a fighter with a pyromantic mantle gain the Blaze trait during that fighter's activation (i.e., not when making Reaction attacks).

### Radcounter[​](#radcounter "Direct link to Radcounter")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: The Book of Peril_  
**50 Credits – Rare (9)**

_Radiation is a common hazard in the underhive. While a few hard rads are just part of life in and among the Badzones, when your hair starts falling out and your skin starts to glow, odds are you've wandered too far into the wilds. Underhivers use a variety of means to detect radiation, from homemade auspexes to sniffer slugs, collectively referred to as radcounters._

A fighter equipped with a radcounter can never be the random target of an Event (see [Badzone Events](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/battlefield-set-up/badzones-battlefields/generating-events)) unless there are no other fighters to choose from.

### Refraction Cloak[​](#refraction-cloak "Direct link to Refraction Cloak")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Necromunda: Hive Secundus Rulebook, p160_

When making a ranged attack against a fighter equipped with a refraction cloak, the Hit roll suffers a -1 penalty to hit. This is increased to -2 if the fighter did not move in their previous activation.

### Rocket Pack[​](#rocket-pack "Direct link to Rocket Pack")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Necromunda: Hive Secundus Rulebook, p160_  
**Van Saar Bioteknist only**

A sophisticated system that interfaces both forearm mounted tools and scanner with a shoulder mounted dispenser, a servo-medicae is the best in field medicine the Van Saar have been able to create. A fighter equipped with a servo-medicae may perform the Medicate (Basic) action.

**Medicate (Basic):** Choose a Seriously Injured friendly fighter within 1" of this fighter. That fighter may make a Recovery roll as if it were the End phase. This does not stop the fighter from making a Recovery test in the End phase if they are still Seriously Injured.

### Sky Mantle[​](#sky-mantle "Direct link to Sky Mantle")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Book of the Outlands_

A fighter equipped with a sky mantle can take the Hide in the Wastes (Double) action.

**Hide in the Wastes (Double):** If this fighter is at least 12" away from the nearest enemy model, they gain the Hidden condition (see the Necromunda: Core Rulebook) even if the current battle is not using the Pitch Black rules. They become Revealed if they move as well as all the normal triggers for becoming Revealed.

# Chems | NecroRAW
[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

Chem Suppliers[​](#chem-suppliers "Direct link to Chem Suppliers")
------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike other kinds of illegal items, chems are in ready supply throughout the underhive. Even so, finding a reliable supply of a particular chem can be difficult with the constant competition between Narco Lords, the sanctions of the Guilders and interference by the Palanite Enforcers.

When a gang buys a chem from the Trading Post, they are buying one dose. This means the chem can be used once – as detailed in its description – and then it is gone. After the gang buys a chem, however, make a note that they have found a supplier for that chem. The next time they want to buy the same chemfrom the Trading Post, it counts as not having the Rare (X) or Illegal (X) rule.

However, after buying a chem from a supplier, the gang rolls a D6. On a 1, the supply has run out (or, more likely, the supplier has been killed!) and the next time the gang wishes to buy the chem the Rare (X) or Illegal (X) rule applies as normal.

When a gang buys a chem, it may buy multiple doses of that chem. These can be distributed among gang members or placed in the gang's Stash for future use.

Side Effects, Duration and Mixing Chems[​](#side-effects-duration-and-mixing-chems "Direct link to Side Effects, Duration and Mixing Chems")
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All chems have 'side effects'. A chem's side effects are detailed under the chem's description and are usually detrimental.

Unless otherwise noted, all chems last for the duration of a single battle and can be taken by a fighter either before the battle begins (the fighter beginning the battle under the chem's effects) or as part of a fighter's activation by performing the Use Chem (Simple) action.

Finally, if a fighter takes more than one chem at a time, there is a chance they will have a bad reaction. Each time a fighter takes a chem while under the effects of one or more other chems, roll a D6. If the result is equal to or less than the number of chems the fighter has taken (counting the chem they just took), the fighter has had a bad reaction. The fighter immediately goes Out of Action, though no roll is made on the Lasting Injuries table, rather they go Into Recovery. If a fighter starts a battle under the effect of more than one chem then they must make this check as soon as they activate.

List of Chems[​](#list-of-chems "Direct link to List of Chems")

### Frenzon[​](#frenzon "Direct link to Frenzon")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**20 Credits – Rare (9)**

Frenzon is a mix of Stimm, Spur, 'Slaught and other combat drugs. The resulting chem turns users into savage killers, intent only upon murdering those in their path. Primarily, Frenzon is used on penal legions or indentured slave troops, both as a means of control and a way to drive soldiers at the enemy with little regard for their own lives. Some gang leaders use it in this way on disposable gangers and juves, though some fighters get a taste for the chem and take it willingly before battle.

A fighter under the influence of Frenzon gains the Nerves of Steel, True Grit, Unstoppable and Berserk skills, however, all their weapons count as having the Reckless trait. Unless the fighter is Standing and Engaged or Prone and Seriously Injured, the fighter must use at least one of their actions to move toward the nearest enemy fighter or perform a Charge (Double) action against a visible enemy if one is within range.

#### Side Effects[​](#side-effects "Direct link to Side Effects")

Frenzon is highly addictive. During the Wrap-up, any fighter who used Frenzon must make a Toughness check, adding 2 to the dice roll. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to Frenzon. Once a fighter is addicted to Frenzon, they can only be included in a crew if they have taken a dose of the chem. The only way a fighter can shake this addiction is to pay 2D6x10 credits for anti-addiction chems during the post-battle sequence when the gang is buying equipment.

### Ghast[​](#ghast "Direct link to Ghast")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**30 Credits – Illegal (9)**

Ghast enhances any latent psychic awareness in the human mind. Ghast-induced psykers lack any real mental strength, though for a brief time they are able to exhibit a single ability, albeit without any great skill. This reason alone is enough to make it a popular chem among the denizens of the underhive.

When a fighter uses Ghast, they roll a D6. On a 1, they become subject to the Insane condition. On a 2-5, they gain a random psychic power from the [Wyrd Powers table](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/the-rules/psykers/#wyrd-powers). On a 6, they both gain a random psychic power and become subject to the Insane condition.

#### Side Effects[​](#side-effects-1 "Direct link to Side Effects")

At the end of any battle in which a fighter used Ghast, they must make a Willpower test. If the test is failed, the fighter suffers a decrease of 1 to their Willpower (i.e., if the fighter's Willpower is 7+, it becomes 8+). If a natural 12 is rolled for the test, the fighter's mind is permanently damaged and they must begin any future battles subject to the Insane condition.

### Icrotic Slime[​](#icrotic-slime "Direct link to Icrotic Slime")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**35 Credits – Rare (10)**

This is a rare and dangerous underhive organism – a living, transparent blob about the size of a human fist. The slime preys upon sleeping or helpless creatures, eating their brains, but giving them a euphoric high as it does so. So great is this high that some fighters let the slime latch onto their head before battle, riding the high and hoping they can scrape it off before it kills them.

When a fighter uses Icrotic Slime, make a Characteristic check for their Movement, Strength, Toughness, Initiative, Attacks and Cool characteristics. For each check that is passed, improve that characteristic by D3.

#### Side Effects[​](#side-effects-2 "Direct link to Side Effects")

Whilst under the effects of Icrotic Slime, the fighter's Leadership, Intelligence and Willpower are decreased to 10+ (unless these characteristics are already worse than this). At the end of any battle in which a fighter used Icrotic Slime, roll 2D6 for that fighter. On a roll of 2, the slime eats the fighter's brain and they are killed. Immediately remove them from the gang's roster. On a roll of 3-11, the slime is successfully removed but the fighter is placed Into Recovery. On a roll of 12, the slime is successfully removed but not without complications. Make a roll on the Lasting Injury table against the fighter, re-rolling results of Bitter Enmity, Captured, Critical Injury and Memorable Death.

### Kalma[​](#kalma "Direct link to Kalma")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**15 Credits**

Kalma is the hive name for a general group of euphoric sedatives which lower the state of consciousness and induce a state of wellbeing. Kalma is sometimes used to sedate prisoners so that they can be led away quickly and easily by Enforcers.

In addition to other methods of use, a gang can give Kalma to a fighter they hold captive during the Rescue scenario. When a fighter affected by Kalma wishes to make an action, roll 2D6 for them and add their Toughness. On a roll of 11 or lower, they do nothing and the action is wasted. On a roll of 12 or more, they shake off the effects of the chem and can act normally for the remainder of the battle.

#### Side Effects[​](#side-effects-3 "Direct link to Side Effects")

There are no long term effects from taking Kalma.

### Obscura[​](#obscura "Direct link to Obscura")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**30 Credits – Illegal (8)**

A recreational narcotic used from the Noble Hedonistia of the spire to the chem dens of the underhive, Obscura sends its users into a dream-like state in which reality melts away around them. This high is followed by a period of crushing depression, alleviated only by the taking of more Obscura. In addition to other methods of use, a gang can give Obscura to a fighter they hold captive during the Rescue scenario. A fighter under the influence of Obscura changes their Movement characteristic to D6" and all their weapons count as having the Reckless trait.

Note that when they move, a fighter under the influence of Obscura must move the full distance rolled in a straight line, even if this would take them into base contact with an enemy fighter, in which case they will engage that enemy fighter, or over the edge of a ledge. Fighters under the influence of Obscura must still respect the 1" rule – if they cannot get into base contact with an enemy fighter when moving, they must stop 1" away.

In the End phase of each round a fighter affected by Obscura may, if their controlling player wishes, roll 2D6 and add their Toughness. If the result is 12 or more, they shake off the effects of the chem.

#### Side Effects[​](#side-effects-4 "Direct link to Side Effects")

When a dose of Obscura wears off, the fighter enters a deep melancholy and they may only perform a single action in each of their activations for the remainder of the battle.

During the Wrap-up, any fighter who used Obscura must make a Toughness check. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to Obscura. Once a fighter is addicted to Obscura, they can only be included in a crew on a D6 roll of a 4+ prior to the battle. The only way a fighter can shake this addiction is to pay 2D6x10 credits for anti-addiction chems during the post-battle sequence when the gang is buying equipment.

### 'Slaught[​](#slaught "Direct link to 'Slaught")

**30 Credits – Rare (10)**

'Slaught, officially known as Onslaught, is a crude combat drug made from a dangerous combination of amphetamines and mutant rat adrenal glands. 'Slaught enhances an individual's fighting abilities; increasing alertness and speed by slowing down a person's perception of the world around them. A fighter affected by 'Slaught increases their Weapon Skill and Initiative to 2+ and adds 1 to their Attacks characteristic.

#### Side Effects[​](#side-effects-5 "Direct link to Side Effects")

During the Wrap-up, any fighter who used 'Slaught must make a Toughness check. If the check is failed, the fighter has become addicted to 'Slaught. In each future battle the fighter takes part in, if they do not take a dose of 'Slaught, they must decrease their Weapon Skill and Initiative to 5+, and their Attacks to 1 (unless these characteristics are already worse than this). If they take a dose, the effects are reduced and their Weapon Skill and Initiative become 3+ and they gain no bonus to their Attacks characteristics. A fighter can shake their addiction to 'Slaught by voluntarily going into Recovery during any post-battle sequence.

### Spur[​](#spur "Direct link to Spur")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**35 Credits – Rare (11)**

The name Spur is given to a number of similar stimulants, all of which boost the nervous system, improving the senses, muscle reaction and speed of thought. However, the chem's effects are short lived and wear off quickly, often after only a few minutes, half an hour at most. A fighter affected by Spur increases their Movement characteristic by 2 and improves their Initiative characteristic to 2+.

#### Side Effects[​](#side-effects-6 "Direct link to Side Effects")

Once a fighter has taken a dose of Spur, they must check to see if it wears off in each subsequent End phase. Roll 2D6 for the fighter and add their Toughness. If the result is 10 or more, the Spur has worn off and the fighter is no longer subject to its effects.

### Stinger Mould[​](#stinger-mould "Direct link to Stinger Mould")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**75 Credits – Rare (13)**

Stinger mould is a rare and precious fungi that grows in isolated patches out in the badzones. The recuperative effects of stinger mould are renowned amongst chirurgeons and doctors, and it is heavily harvested in some areas for use in the hive, the spire and even off-world.

A dose of Stinger Mould can be used after a fighter has rolled on the Lasting Injury table. If the result of the roll was anything other than a 66 – Memorable Death, the result is ignored (including positive results such as 11 – Lesson Learned) and the fighter is instead Out Cold.

Alternatively, a fighter can attempt to use a dose of Stinger Mould to remove an existing Lasting Injury. During Step 6 of the post-battle sequence, after distributing equipment but before updating the gang roster, roll a D6 for any fighter attempting to use Stinger Mould in this way. On a 5 or 6, the effects of one Lasting Injury the fighter has suffered are immediately negated.

#### Side Effects[​](#side-effects-7 "Direct link to Side Effects")

There are no long term effects of taking Stinger Mould

An Unwieldy ranged weapon fitted with suspensors is far more manoeuvrable. Firing it becomes a Basic action rather than a Double action.

An Unwieldy close combat weapon fitted with suspensors can be used single-handedly, allowing the fighter to use a second close combat weapon.

A weapon fitted with a focusing crystal improves its AP characteristic by 2 (for example, a weapon with an AP of -1 would improve its AP to -3 when fitted with a focusing crystal). However, such modifications are not without risk, and a weapon fitted with a focusing crystal also gains the Unstable trait.

Exotic Beasts, stolen relics or flamboyant opulence, when the money starts rolling in, underhive gangers are notorious for their tendency to flash their cash, spending it on all manner of extravagances that leave others in no doubt as to their success and importance, not only within their own gang, but within their House and the wider underhive. Unfortunately, such gaudy displays of wealth often leave others questioning the ganger's sense of style, and in extreme cases, their gullibility!

Representing the fruits of a successful career, Extravagant Goods are only available to fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule, to Gang Leaders or to Champions.

**50 Credits – Rare (12)**

Many gangers excel at the hunt for rare and exotic goods, building up a network of trusted suppliers and contacts. They often have ready personal access to a wealth of rare off-world trade and they delight in flaunting their status through the wearing of many strange items. Should this fighter make a Trade action in the post-battle sequence, they add an additional +1 modifier to the dice roll to determine the Availability Level.

### Gold-Plated Gun[​](#gold-plated-gun "Direct link to Gold-Plated Gun")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**40 Credits – Rare (10)**

Gang fighters take tremendous pride in their weapons, they are the tools of their trade and a clear badge of office, and a finely crafted piece is a possession to treasure. Over time, successful members of a gang's hierarchy are likely to expend considerable sums on upgrading and improving their weapons, and for those gangers who want a clear and public statement that such craftsmanship has been undertaken, nothing beats the gaudiness of having the entire weapon plated in gold. Any ranged weapon can be gold-plated. A fighter with a gold-plated gun improves their Leadership characteristic by 1. Additionally, once per battle, the fighter may re-roll a failed Ammo test.

### Master-Crafted Weapon[​](#master-crafted-weapon "Direct link to Master-Crafted Weapon")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**\* Credits – Rare (10)**  
_\*25% of the cost of the weapon, rounded up to the nearest 5 credits_

The fighter purchases a new weapon of exceptional craftsmanship. Any weapon may be master-crafted (note that grenades are Wargear, not weapons). The cost of a master-crafted weapon is that of the weapon plus 25%, with fractions rounded up to the nearest 5 credits. For example, a master-crafted bolter/ plasma combi-weapon would cost 145 credits (115 credits plus 25% equals 143.75 credits. Rounded up to the nearest 5 credits, this weapon costs 145 credits).

Note that the fighter may replace a weapon with which they are already equipped with a master-crafted version of that weapon, and that the original may be discarded and added to the gang's Stash. This is an exception to the norm.

A master-crafted weapon is a normal weapon of its type that gains the Master-crafted trait.

**80 Credits – Rare (11)**

As wealth increases, gangers find themselves able to attain items that other dwellers of the underhive could never afford. They are attracted to the glitter and glimmer of fine jewellery like sheen birds to a heat sink. Many Guilders make a pretty profit selling gaudy, low quality junk to gangers eager to prove that they too have the wealth of the uphive gentry, and it is interesting to note that many gangers believe the purest gold turns the skin green. If this fighter makes a Medical Escort action in the post-battle sequence, they will attempt to impress the Doc with their visible wealth. Sometimes this works, sometimes it does not…

The player may re-roll the dice when determining the fee the Doc charges, but must accept the second result, even if it is worse.

### Uphive Raiments[​](#uphive-raiments "Direct link to Uphive Raiments")

The styles and fashions of uphive folk are rarely seen first-hand in the underhive and yet they still have a huge influence on the denizens of the lower hab levels, those who toil in the manufactoria and grease the gears of Imperial industry with their blood and sweat, for they will see flashes of how the uphivers dress on news reels on their pict viewers. Gang leaders, however, often possess the wealth to acquire such fabulous goods, and they have no hesitation in flaunting their new-found chic. If this fighter is not In Recovery during the post-battle sequence, their gang gains an extra D3x10 credits during the Collect Income step.

Servo-skulls[​](#servo-skulls "Direct link to Servo-skulls")
------------------------------------------------------------

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_

The manufacture of servo-skulls is common across the Imperium, yet they remain incredibly rare artefacts normally only found in the company of nobility, priests, military or naval officers, or even in the service of Rogue Traders and Inquisitors. Most commonly they are made from the skulls of the most devout of the Emperor's servants, their duty continuing beyond death. Yet they do appear in the underhive, occasionally coming up for sale offered by a Guilder or trader unwilling to speak about their provenance, or, more rarely still, as antiques of certain houses, artefacts of a famous gang noble from history perhaps.

Servo-skulls are only available to fighters with the Gang Hierarchy (X) special rule, to Gang Leaders or to Champions. All servo-skulls are treated as ordinary Wargear and should be recorded on their owner's Fighter card accordingly. Servo-skulls follow these rules:

*   Servo-skulls must be represented by a separate model that must stay within 2" of the owning fighter. This is not a fighter; it is purely a marker representing the servo-skull and matters only for its own line of sight and targeting purposes. Nor will they give away their owner's location, as they are assumed to be aware enough of stealthy movement to emulate it, and remain very low and close when needed.
*   When the owner activates, the servo-skull will move with them. Servo-skulls ignore all terrain other than impassable terrain or walls, and can never fall.
*   Servo-skulls cannot be targeted by shooting or melee attacks, and can never be engaged in combat – they simply float away.
*   Servo-skulls may be caught by a Blast marker or Flame template. If a servo-skull is caught under a Blast marker or Flame template, the attacker rolls a D6. On a 4-6, it is hit by the attack. On a 1-3, it is able to float clear of the area of the attack. Leave the model where it is and assume it has bobbed around to avoid the attack and returned to where it was. If a servo-skull is hit in this way, the owning player rolls a D6. On a 1, it is destroyed and should be removed from the owning fighter's Fighter card. On a 2-6, it is taken Out of Action and plays no further part in the battle, but otherwise suffers no long-term effects.
*   If the owning fighter leaves the battlefield for any reason, the servo-skull will accompany them and takes no further part in the battle.

### Sensor Skull[​](#sensor-skull "Direct link to Sensor Skull")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**60 Credits – Rare (12)**

A sensor skull grants the owning fighter the same benefits as a [bio-scanner](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/trading-post/personal-equipment#bio-scanner). In addition, when the fighter takes an Aim (Basic) action, they may add 2 to the result of any hit rolls they make for subsequent shots taken in the same activation rather than the usual 1. This bonus is in addition to any granted by any other Wargear or skills the fighter may have.

### Medi Skull[​](#medi-skull "Direct link to Medi Skull")

**80 Credits – Rare (12)**

When making a Recovery test for the owning fighter, roll an extra Injury dice, then choose one of the dice to resolve and discard the other. This is in addition to any friendly fighters assisting the recovery and any other items such as medicae kits, so it is possible that the owning fighter may be rolling several Injury dice to choose from.

### Gun Skull[​](#gun-skull "Direct link to Gun Skull")

[RAW ✔️](https://www.necroraw.ru/docs/publication-index/rules-index) _Source: Necromunda Core Rulebook (2023)_  
**65 Credits – Rare (12)**

A gun skull is equipped with a compact autopistol and will target whatever or whoever the owning fighter does when they make a ranged attack. Simply roll one extra hit dice and one extra Ammo dice for the gun skull, ideally of a different colour to those being used for the fighter, to represent the gun skull making a ranged attack. Note though that range, line of sight and cover must be worked out from the gun skull itself rather than that of the owning fighter. If the owning fighter does not possess any ranged weapons, the gun skull may shoot at an enemy it can see, chosen by the owning fighter and following the normal target priority rules in relation to the owning fighter's position.

The owning fighter is never considered to be in the way of a gun skull's shooting attacks and cannot be hit by stray shots.

A gun skull has a BS of 5+, and may never benefit from aiming or any Wargear or skills that modify the owning fighter's hit rolls.
